# MyMonoGames
Framework API and Games I made during my studies using MonoGame (2018)

## Context

During my computer science studies at UCA, I've been doing little games and simulation using MonoGame.

I coded some things (some that are now implemented, or maybe always had been) by myself, over the MonoGame game loop, and expended it's API.
